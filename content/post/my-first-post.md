# My first post

# My second post

This is my first post in Hugo - the static site generator

> Hugo is supposed to be fast! Let's check the null hypothesis.

## Various features of markdown

Let us try the various features of markdown

### Code rendering

    var s = "JavaScript syntax highlighting";
    alert(s);

    # This is a comment
    s = "Python syntax highlighting"
    print s

    No language indicated, so no syntax highlighting. 
    But let's throw in a <b>tag</b>.

### Ordered List

1. First
2. Second
3. Third

### Unordered list

* First
* Second
* Third

### Blockquote

> Blockquote is already tried

### Table rendering

| Temperature | No of customers |
| :---: | :---: |
| 97 | 14 |
| 86 | 11 |
| 89 | 9 |
| 84 | 9 |
| 94 | 15 |
| 74 | 7 |

### Latex Expressions

$$
\\mathbf{H}_\\mathbf{0} : \\mu = 500
$$

## Summary

This is my first sample blog post and let me check how well it is!
